One important CSF biomarker is the amyloid beta 42 (A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>) peptide, a key player in AD pathogenesis. The INNOTEST&#x000ae; A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> ELISA kit has been widely used but an advanced level of method development and validation has not been reported. To support a clinical trial in AD, we successfully completed a Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-level validation of the method to establish the parameters of precision, accuracy, parallelism, selectivity, specificity, and linearity of dilution of the assay in CSF matrix, as well as CSF storage stability. Several modifications were required to optimize the assay and ensure consistent results in a clinical-trial setting. These included the use of additional calibrators, an adjusted standard curve range, a minimum required dilution (MRD) of CSF by 6-fold to avoid matrix interference and mitigation of analyte adsorption to labware by the addition of Tween-20. The optimized method displayed a quantitative range of 375&#x02013;4,500&#x000a0;pg/mL. The inter-assay precision was &#x02264;12.1&#x000a0;% CV and the inter-assay relative accuracy was &#x02264;10.9&#x000a0;% absolute bias, bringing the total error of the assay to &#x02264;23&#x000a0;%. The intra-assay precision of the assay at the high validation standard and below was &#x02264;5.5&#x000a0;% CV; this enables sensitive detection of biomarker changes across a therapeutic regime. The INNOTEST&#x000ae; A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> ELISA kit, modified as reported here, may be appropriate for many applications, including regulatory agency acceptable clinical diagnosis and pharmacodynamic assessment.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1208/s12248-012-9360-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>AB42</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</kwd><kwd>method validation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) affects millions worldwide, with rising incidence as populations age. Despite extensive efforts across industry and academia, an effective strategy for disease modification remains elusive. Amongst the main concerns has been how to predict who will succumb to AD and how to monitor clinical improvement during therapeutic intervention. To this end, AD biomarkers have received much attention, including CSF amyloid beta 42 (A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>), which is lower in AD patients than in normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Low CSF A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> levels also predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>).</p><p>Most A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> assays rely on immunochemical detection, whether conventional ELISAs, electrochemiluminescence-based ELISAs or bead-based methods. One of the most widely used assays is the INNOTEST&#x000ae; ELISA from Innogenetics NV which has been cited in numerous publications from many study centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>).</p><p>Published studies using this kit invariably conduct the assay on neat CSF according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. To our knowledge, no group has undertaken an independent and comprehensive method development and validation study for this assay.</p><p>In the present study, we first undertook an extensive method development study of the INNOTEST&#x000ae; A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> ELISA, creating a number of important modifications to the assay. These were: (1) establishment of the minimum required dilution (MRD) for CSF samples, which upon empirical testing in both AD and normal human CSF was a dilution of one in six, (2) changes in the calibration curve design to better bracket A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> concentration ranges observed in clinical samples, and (3) introduction of quality control (QC) samples composed of human CSF from pre-mortem AD donors.</p><p>We also systematically examined A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> recovery from storage and assay vials. Although polypropylene is considered to be the least problematic polymer for adherence of hydrophobic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>), it is known that A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> can variably adsorb to polypropylene vials made by different manufacturers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). Since such adsorbance would impair assay precision and accuracy, we tested different polypropylene vial types for A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> recovery after freeze/thaw, and we established a mitigation strategy in the event of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> adsorbance.</p><p>Once these modifications were established, we then executed a full method validation in which the assay was characterized in terms of precision, accuracy<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>, selectivity, specificity, parallelism, linearity of dilution, and stability. The guidelines for biomarker assay validation set out by Lee <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) were used as guiding principles. As presented herein, the assay performs very well with excellent precision, accuracy and reliability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>INNOTEST&#x000ae; &#x003b2;-AMYLOID<sub>(1&#x02013;42)</sub> assay kit was obtained from Innogenetics (Ghent, Belgium) and utilizes a 21F12/3D6 sandwich pair and a A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> peptide solution as calibration standard.

Additionally, two individual incurred samples (IS) were analyzed during the core runs and mean endogenous analyte levels were qualified for use in all stability assays. Each VS and IS sample was treated with 2.2&#x000a0;% Tween-20 at 10&#x000a0;% of total volume for at least 30&#x000a0;min and then diluted 6-fold in Sample Diluent for a final Tween-20 concentration of 0.033&#x000a0;%.

The &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;% recovery in LoBind tubes indicated that the low recoveries observed in Nunc vials was due to adsorption of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> to tube walls (as opposed to degradation or aggregation).

An approximate clinical reference range of 1,500 to 3,500&#x000a0;pg/mL was established by analyzing multiple CSF samples from early AD patients both at an MRD of six and treated with Tween-20 (data not shown). The calibration range of the original assay extended to 2,000&#x000a0;pg/mL; since the incurred CSF samples were subjected to MRD and the buffer-based synthetic calibrators were not, the range of quantification was effectively magnified 6-fold (to 12,000&#x000a0;pg/mL) with the original calibration curve. To better span the expected concentration range of samples, the highest calibrator was reduced from 2,000 to 1,000&#x000a0;pg/mL per well (6,000&#x000a0;pg/mL after adjustment for MRD). A 10-point calibration curve was designed to place 7 points in the quantification range and include three anchor points.

However, to establish the full quantitative range of the method and to allow for potential modulation of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> concentration upon therapy, adulteration of the CSF was necessary: HQC and ULOQ were created by spiking in synthetic A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> and LLOQ was generated by dilution of CSF in assay buffer. Both manipulations (spiking or dilution) were supported by the MRD/Parallelism experiments (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), in that synthetic analyte possessed a similar concentration/signal correlation to endogenous A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> and back-calculated sample concentrations remain constant at CSF levels below 16.7&#x000a0;%. We believe that the use of highly relevant human CSF for method validation and QC, represents a significant improvement over buffer-based or remnant CSF approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Performance of the Optimized Method</title><p>The process of method validation revealed that the optimized method is suitable for the detection of biomarker shifts during a clinical study. The intra-assay precision throughout the quantitative range was determined to be below 10&#x000a0;% and both the intra- and inter-assay precision results compare well to commonly employed acceptance criteria for biomarker assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). As discussed above, accuracy could be validated only to a relative level due to the presence of endogenous analyte in all human CSF samples. Although absolute accuracy is ultimately not required for use of the method to assess therapeutic effects, the mitigation of two major sources of inaccuracy as reported here represents significant progress toward that goal. Further development of the method as a diagnostic tool would require cross validation with other validated quantitative techniques in order to confirm absolute accuracy. Despite the limitations imposed by the matrix in question, the accuracy results and total error calculations generated during method validation revealed the consistency of quantitation across the entire quantitative range and compare well to the biomarker field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). The optimized method is selective and specific for A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>, is free of the artifacts of non-parallelism, dilutional non-linearity, and hook effect, and is tolerant of significant blood contamination of CSF. The CSF-based QC samples introduced into the method are stable under conditions expected during normal assay execution, and CSF samples can be stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C for at least 3&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Implications for the AD Field</title><p>In addition to diagnosing and stratifying patients, there is an increasing interest in using CSF A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> changes as a potential marker of drug efficacy, therefore requiring a reliable, accurate and precise A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> assay. However, the lack of rigorously validated methods, as well as the documented variability both between and within commonly used A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> assay platforms has impeded the use of these assays in drug trials. In this present study, we have demonstrated that the INNOTEST A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> assay meets advanced validation criteria when an MRD is incorporated, and is thus useful for measuring drug induced biomarker changes. However, the different absolute values between platforms create uncertainty in the absolute accuracy of each method. In several recent reports, QC human CSF samples were tested in three commonly used assay kits: INNO-BIA AlzBio3&#x000ae; (a Luminex bead-based method), the MSD&#x000ae; MULTI-SPOT&#x000ae; Human (6E10) Abeta Triplex Assay, and the INNOTEST A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Marked differences in A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> concentration within the same CSF sample were revealed when the methods were compared, with some differences of greater than 3-fold reported. The increase in A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> concentration upon dilution to MRD and adsorption mitigation revealed in this report raises the distinct possibility that matrix effects and/or adsorbance contribute to the observed inter-platform discordance. Careful validation of all CSF A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> assays would surely advance the effort to harmonize the clinical application of these technologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, we have conducted the first GLP-level method development and advanced validation of a method for the quantitation of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> in human CSF. Mitigation of both matrix interference and analyte adsorption were critical to a successful validation. In addition, we have conducted this validation using CSF from individual AD patients for all critical experiments including precision and accuracy. This modified ELISA assay can be used with confidence to precisely and accurately measure CSF A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> in current and future clinical studies of novel therapeutic modalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic Supplementary Materials</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material id="Fig6" content-type="local-data"><media id="MO6" xlink:href="12248_2012_9360_Fig6_ESM.jpg"><label>Supplementary Fig. 1a</label><caption><p>Method schematics for adsorption testing, in Nunc cryovials (<bold>a</bold>).
