We evaluated several methods of performing covariate analyses with partially missing categorical covariate data. Missing data methods consisted of discarding data (DROP), additional effect parameter for the group with missing data (EXTRA), and mixture methods in which the mixing probability was fixed to the observed fraction of categories (MIX<sub>obs</sub>), based on the likelihood of the concentration data (MIX<sub>conc</sub>), or combined likelihood of observed covariate data and concentration data (MIX<sub>joint</sub>). Simulations were implemented to study bias and imprecision of the methods in datasets with equal-sized and unbalanced category ratios for a binary covariate as well as datasets with non-random missingness (MNAR). Additionally, the performance and feasibility of implementation was assessed in two real datasets. At either low (10%) or high (50%) levels of missingness, all methods performed similarly well. Performance was similar for situations with unbalanced datasets (3:1 covariate distribution) and balanced datasets. In the MNAR scenario, the MIX methods showed a higher bias in the estimation of <italic>CL</italic> and covariate effect than EXTRA. All methods could be applied to real datasets, except DROP. All methods perform similarly at the studied levels of missingness, but the DROP and EXTRA methods provided less bias than the mixture methods in the case of MNAR. However, EXTRA was associated with inflated type I error rates of covariate selection, while DROP handled data inefficiently.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1208/s12248-012-9373-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>categorical data</kwd><kwd>covariates</kwd><kwd>missing data</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacometrics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) and or pharmacodynamic modeling analyses, the researcher is often confronted with missing data due to left censoring (<italic>e.g.</italic>, data below the lower limit of quantification), data not being measured or recorded (<italic>e.g.</italic>, genotype data), or data missing for other reasons. Handling of missing covariate data in PopPK analyses in an appropriate way, <italic>i.e.</italic>, one that does not induce bias or imprecision in model parameter estimation is important, and several methods are available to the modeler. However, most established methods focus on missing <italic>continuous</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Briefly, these consist of case deletion, single and multiple imputation methods, and maximum likelihood methods.</p><p>In several PopPK analyses performed by our group, missing data of the categorical type were encountered, which were handled in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). In this article, we evaluated the performance of several methods for handling missing categorical data in nonlinear mixed-effects analyses. This was done both by simulations and by retrospective analysis of some of the cited studies. We have investigated the impact of these methods on the estimation of parameters, type I error of covariate inclusion (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the probability of falsely demonstrating a significant covariate relationship), and the feasibility of implementing the methods.</p><p>The nature of missing data can be separated into several classes with somewhat confusing terms: data can be missing at random (MAR), missing completely at random (MCAR), or missing not at random (MNAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). The situation of MCAR occurs when the missingness does not depend on any (observed or unobserved) data or model parameters. The situation of MNAR, in which the missingness pattern is (partly) dependent on the missing data itself, occurs, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in the situation of data below the lower limit of quantification. The MAR situation occurs when the observed missingness pattern depends on the observed data, but not on the missing data. Both situations of random missingness and non-random missingness were investigated in this study.</p><p>For application in PopPK analyses performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with NONMEM, we identified five methods for handling missing categorical data, which are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>: discarding subjects with missing data (DROP), estimation of an additional covariate effect for the missing group (EXTRA), and several methods using mixture models (MIX). A mixture model is a model that explicitly assumes that the population consists of two or more subpopulations. Each of these subpopulations can be defined as having its own model with associated population parameter values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). With two subpopulations, as in the analyses presented here, some fraction <italic>p</italic> of the population has one set of typical values, while the remaining fraction (1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>p</italic>) has another set. The fraction(s) of subjects in each category can either be set to the fraction observed in the non-missing subjects (MIX<sub>obs</sub>), estimated based on the maximization of the likelihood of PK concentration data alone (MIX<sub>conc</sub>) or estimated based on the likelihood of both PK concentration data and observed categories for non-missing subjects (MIX<sub>joint</sub>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Methods for Dealing with Missing Categorical Data</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DROP</td><td>Case deletion method.

We also included situations with non-ignorable missingness, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the percentage of missing depended on the value of the covariate. In statistical literature, several methods have been presented to cope with non-ignorable missing data, most of them using maximum likelihood approaches to handle these data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>).

The simulations were performed for both a scenario of MCAR and a scenario of MNAR. In the MNAR scenario, the missingness depended on the value of the covariate (when COM&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, the probability of missingness was three times higher). Baseline probabilities (for COM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) of being missing were 10%, 20%, and 30% (so 30%, 60%, and 90% for occasions where COM&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).</p></list-item></list></p><p>These scenarios, with a moderate covariate effect magnitude on CL (<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>male</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.25), a moderate magnitude of between-subject variability (25%), and a moderate magnitude of residual error (20%), were considered &#x0201c;moderately informative&#x0201d; to assess the impact of SEX on CL.

Estimation of <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> was also comparable between all mixture methods. The results of the analyses of the &#x0201c;informative&#x0201d; datasets are not shown in this paper as the differences between methods were very low or non-existent and probably also not commonly observed in actual PK analyses. Results from the scenario which analyzed simulated data with a higher percentage of IIV (50% in both CL and <italic>V</italic>) were also evaluated, which were very similar to those obtained for the &#x0201c;moderately informative&#x0201d; scenario and are therefore not presented.</p><p>In the unbalanced datasets &#x0201c;F+&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;M+,&#x0201d; the estimation of CL and the covariate effect magnitude were highly similar to the results obtained with the balanced (50/50) dataset using all missing data methods (not shown). The estimation of mixing probabilities in the MIX methods showed the lowest bias and imprecision at all levels when using MIX<sub>joint</sub> (Electronic supplementary material (ESM) Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S-1</xref>), similar to our experience with the balanced dataset.</p><p>In the situation of non-random missingness with 50% missing covariate data, low bias and imprecision in the estimation of CL and <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>male</sub> were observed for the DROP and EXTRA methods, showing RMSE values similar to those obtained with the balanced dataset. However, using the MIX<sub>obs</sub> method, a considerable positive bias in the estimation of CL was observed (mean bias, +10%; RMSE&#x02009;=&#x02009;8%), while bias was much lower using MIX<sub>conc</sub> or MIX<sub>joint</sub>, which is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> could only be estimated without bias using the MIX<sub>joint</sub> method and was overpredicted using MIX<sub>conc</sub> (not shown). These data suggest that if the estimate for <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> using the MIX<sub>conc</sub> method is markedly different from <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> established from the observed data, this might be an indication of the presence of non-random missingness (MNAR) in the dataset. When re-estimating models based on datasets containing no covariate effect, the estimation of CL was unbiased with all methods, although MIX<sub>conc</sub> and, to a lesser extent, MIX<sub>joint</sub>, overestimated the parameter value.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>&#x0201c;NonRand&#x0201d; dataset: bias in CL (<italic>left</italic>) and covariate effect size (<italic>right</italic>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12248_2012_9373_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>The performance of the methods in the <italic>sparse sampling</italic> scenarios showed similar performance for all methods regarding bias and imprecision in parameter estimation, with good to moderate estimation for CL, but a much higher bias/imprecision for the covariate effect magnitude. Most interestingly, at the higher level of missingness, the ability to identify the true structural model (two-compartment <italic>versus</italic> one-compartment) was different between DROP and the other methods. For DROP, the ability to identify the correct model from the simulated data was about similar for the 10% missingness scenario, but in the 50% missingness scenario, for 14% of the re-estimations, the simpler one-compartmental model would have been selected (using a cutoff of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 (dOFV&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6.63 in model selection) as the structural model (ESM Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S-2</xref> compares DROP and EXTRA methods).</p><p>For the simulated scenario of a <italic>time-varying</italic> covariate, the performance of both DROP and EXTRA methods was good, as can be seen from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.

Additionally, estimates for <italic>ka</italic> were different between methods. However, similar estimates were obtained for <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>Asian</sub> when using any of the mixture methods, but were estimated to be about 30% higher than when using the EXTRA method. It was noted that model estimation was not supported from the remaining data when using the DROP method as the parameters for the structural model established for this compound (two-compartment) could not be estimated. Estimation of a one-compartmental model resulted in the phenomenon of flip-flop PK, which could not be resolved easily, and the DROP method was therefore considered invalid for this specific analysis. The mixture methods were also able to estimate the effect magnitude with a lower imprecision than the EXTRA method (lower relative standard errors, RSE). The difference between methods in the estimation of <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>Bili</sub> was less pronounced, with slightly higher estimates for the mixture method compared to EXTRA. Mixing probabilities estimated with the MIX<sub>joint</sub> method for both covariates were close to those observed and could be estimated with reasonable accuracy (~30%). In contrast, the MIX<sub>conc</sub> method estimated the <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> close to 0% (resulting in an imputation of 0 for all subjects for this category) and was therefore fixed to

The simulation studies and modeling analyses of real datasets described here showed the advantages and drawbacks of the use of various methods for handling missing categorical covariate data. Adequate assessment of covariate relationships is important since a biased estimation of effect size may also lead to falsely establishing significance of covariates or erroneous rejection of true covariate relationships. A frequently used approach for handling missing data is single or multiple imputations (MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), but these techniques were not evaluated in this article. MI has been applied in modeling with NONMEM, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), but this technique requires additional simulation steps and cannot be deployed in a single NONMEM estimation. Furthermore, since imputation requires additional computation, estimates obtained by these methods may be considered less efficient than those obtained from likelihood-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). Therefore, we chose not to include imputation methods in this analysis and focused on methods that can be applied more conveniently from within NONMEM. The current analysis was restricted to binary covariates. While some of our results and conclusions may be extrapolated to categorical covariate data of more than two categories (<italic>e.g.</italic>, metabolizer status), the performance of the missing data methods should ideally be investigated as a new case.</p><p>In the simulation study presented here, it was shown that all five methods provided adequate performance (bias/imprecision) at either low (10%) or high (50%) level of missingness. DROP is the simplest method presented here, but since in the DROP method data are discarded, information not only on the covariate effect but also on other PK parameters is discarded, thereby qualifying on theoretical grounds as an inferior method compared to the other methods. This issue was demonstrated in the analysis of sparse data for the two-compartmental PK model. In 14% of the cases, the simpler one-compartmental model was chosen over the true model, <italic>i.e.</italic>, resulting in lack of significance due to the lack of data. EXTRA is the next simplest method to implement and performs rather well in the estimation of covariate effects and PK parameters. A disadvantage of using the EXTRA method is that it showed higher type I errors. This is probably due to the fact that, in principle, a model misspecification is introduced in the model and model misspecifications are usually associated with higher type I error rates. This could be circumvented by adjusting to the actual significance level by performing a simulation and re-estimation analysis for the covariate analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>), although it is impractical to do so for every covariate analysis. A considerable advantage of the DROP and EXTRA methods over the MIX methods is that they are relatively simple to implement and can be applied in analyses were data from more than one covariate are missing as well as in automated covariate modeling procedures. For a scenario studying a sparse sampling design, performance was very similar across methods.</p><p>MIX<sub>obs</sub>, the simplest mixture method for dealing with missing covariate data, often provides adequate results and also showed the lowest type I/II error of covariate inclusion of all methods. However, when non-random missingness (MNAR) is present in the data, the use of the observed category distribution, as is done in the MIX<sub>obs</sub> method, induced bias in the estimation of the parameter correlating with the covariate (CL in this analysis) while estimation of the covariate effect magnitude itself was unaffected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In this situation, all other methods resulted in estimates of CL and covariate effect size that were only slightly biased. Forcing the mixture model into a different mixture than present in the actual overall population causes the failure of MIX<sub>obs</sub> in the situation of MNAR data. In our example, this could only be &#x0201c;corrected&#x0201d; by estimation of a higher value for CL. The other methods showed very low bias in the MNAR scenario. It may be that at more extreme scenarios of MNAR (for even higher probabilities of missingness in one category or at even higher percentages of missingness), bias and imprecision will increase.</p><p>Both in the simulations and in the analysis of real data, MIX<sub>conc</sub> performed poorly, regularly running into the 0 or 1 boundary for <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub>, which was (logically) especially the case when the amount of missing data was low. As expected, analysis of datasets with larger covariate effects (<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub>male</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) showed better performance, equaling the performance of MIX<sub>joint</sub>.</p><p>The analysis of the efavirenz dataset showed that the MIX methods also allow the handling of more than one covariate with missing data. However, the implementation of mixture models quickly becomes more complex at higher numbers of covariates with missing data, requiring <italic>x</italic><sup><italic>n</italic></sup> subpopulations in the mixture model for <italic>n</italic> covariates with missing data and <italic>x</italic> categories per covariate as well as a multitude of additional lines of code to cope with the estimation of the covariate effects. We did not evaluate the estimation of mixture models with more than four subpopulations (=two covariates), but it is likely that for the distinction of higher numbers of subpopulations, estimation of the mixing probabilities will become unstable if the dataset does not contain sufficient information. To complicate matters, correlations between mixture probabilities may also be present in the data, <italic>e.g.</italic>, a larger portion of women having increased bilirubin levels than men. Therefore, the use of mixture models is limited to simpler covariate analyses.</p><p>In the simulation study, it was noted that non-random missingness induced a difference in the estimated mixing probabilities between the MIX<sub>obs</sub> and MIX<sub>conc</sub> methods. Since such a difference was also found in the analysis of efavirenz for <italic>p</italic><sub>mix,bili</sub>, it is tempting to conclude that non-random missingness in that covariate was also present in the dataset of efavirenz. This may of course be possible, but the amount of missingness (11%) and the fraction of patients with elevated bilirubin levels (observed, 8%) were likely too low to substantiate this conclusion. Convergence problems with the DROP method for this problem could not easily be solved. Possibly, with more exhaustive efforts, the problem may have been solved, <italic>e.g.</italic>, using different estimation methods or changes in model structure, but our goal was to judge the general performance in a retrospective analysis without performing additional model construction.</p><p>Due to the very low amount of missing data on ASAT (3.5%) in the nevirapine dataset, no relevant differences were observed between parameter estimates obtained with the different methods. The low amount of missing ASAT data explains why <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> could not be estimated in the MIX<sub>conc</sub> method: due to the low amount of information in the remaining concentration data on ASAT (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 patients), this was not sufficient to discriminate between patients with increased and normal ASAT. Using MIX<sub>joint</sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub>mix</sub> could be estimated adequately due to the extra information on ASAT supplied to the model, and the estimate expectedly did not differ much from the observed <italic>p</italic><sub>obs</sub>.</p><p>A drawback of implementing the MIX<sub>joint</sub> method is that the Laplacian estimation method in NONMEM has to be used, which is known to be more prone to convergence problems during estimation. We did not, however, experience any problems during the simulation study or with the real dataset. Another hurdle in the implementation of MIX<sub>joint</sub> is that the dataset needs to be updated to include the data on the studied covariate as a dependent variable. In addition to the approaches presented here, it is possible to incorporate the observed fraction of patients as a prior on the estimated covariate effect. In terms of dependence on the use of observed covariate data for the estimation of mixing probability, this approach can be placed somewhere between MIX<sub>obs</sub> and MIX<sub>conc</sub>, depending on the weight given to the priors. Such an approach is likely to perform similar to MIX<sub>joint</sub> and would also circumvent possible problems associated with using the Laplacian estimation method.</p><p>Concluding, we showed that at low to intermediate percentages of missingness, all evaluated methods perform similarly with respect to bias and imprecision in parameter estimates. In the situation of non-random missingness, DROP and EXTRA methods showed less bias than the mixture methods. Since it is usually not known whether data are missing randomly or not, and due to its ease of implementation, the DROP or EXTRA method can be considered appropriate methods for handling missing categorical data. If the data are rich enough to allow appropriate model construction and parameter estimation, the DROP method is advised since the EXTRA method may increase the type I error for covariate selection. As shown, the DROP method is, however, data inefficient. Since the simulation scenarios presented in this article are inherently arbitrary, if the problem is relevantly different from the scenarios presented here, it is advised to implement a simulation study to evaluate the performance of missing data methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec
